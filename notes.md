# App documentation

MODULES:
> Each application has at least one module, a root module. The root module is the starting point Nest uses to build the application graph - the internal data structure Nest uses to resolve module and provider relationships and dependencies;

> In Nest, modules are singletons by default, and thus you can share the same instance of any provider between multiple modules;
